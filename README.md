# fire-spread-sim

This project presents a stochastic wildfire simulation framework that models fire dynamics over a synthetically generated environment. The system integrates three core components: synthetic landscape generation, probabilistic cellular automaton fire spread modeling, and Monte Carlo risk forecasting. Synthetic raster layers include digital elevation, slope, aspect, fuel density, moisture, and asset maps. These layers were created by fractal noise to emulate realistic terrains independent of empirical datasets. Modeling fire spread in such a probabilistic environment allows fire transitions between unburned, burning, and burnt states to be based on the local environment, including fuel load, slope, moisture, and wind direction. Monte Carlo simulations of stochastic variability sample diverse weather and ignition scenarios, allowing the estimation of per-cell burn probabilities and asset risk metrics. This model should provide a good basis for work on the problem of wildfire propagation under uncertainty, supporting both academic research and practical risk assessment in data-scarce regions through efficient synthetic simulations.
